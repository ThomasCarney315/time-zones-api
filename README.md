# Time Zones API
This is a simple API for developers who want a short simplified aggregation of time zones.

**Link to project:** ---

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js

I researched and collected data on all existing timezones, reduced the list to STANDARD time zones, and then further reduced the list to the single most common zone from each hour.
With the reduced information, from scratch, I coded out the API Object and built out a simple backend to serve up JSON using Node.js and Express.js. 
I then hosted the API on <a href="https://www.cyclic.sh/">Cyclic</a>.
